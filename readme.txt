== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I change SplideJS slider settings? =
The file './src/options.json' contains an object that is passed to the 'frontend.js' script. You can simply add your options there, then rebuild the project with 'npm build'.

= What is the innerBlockWrapper.js for? =
This file is used to wrap the inner blocks in the slider. Due to the nature of gutenberg it is not directly possible to allow block-variations with specific attributes to be added.
This is a workaround to get blocks with presets to work.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
